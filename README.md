### Introduction
Maze Escape is a text-based game where you navigate through a maze-like grid to reach the end point. The game consists of multiple levels, each with increasing difficulty.

### Features
- Randomly generated maze-like grids for each level.
- Obstacles and pitfalls scattered throughout the grid to challenge the player.
- Simple controls for movement: Up (8), Down (2), Left (4), Right (6).
- Clear rules and instructions provided at the start of the game.

### How to Play
1. Compile and run the `version.c` file using a C compiler.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to navigate through the maze.
3. Use the controls to move the player character ('P') towards the exit ('E').
4. Avoid obstacles ('X') and pitfalls ('*') to prevent losing the game.
5. Reach the end point to progress to the next level.
